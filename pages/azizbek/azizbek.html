              <p class="singer__info">
                Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known
                professionally as Eminem, is an American rapper, songwriter, and
                record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in
                middle America and is widely considered as one of the greatest
                rappers of all time.Eminem's global success and acclaimed works
                are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the
                acceptance of Caucasian rappers in popular music. While much of
                his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s
                made him widely controversial, he came to be a representation of
                popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as
                an influence for many artists of various genres.

                In early 2015, Puth signed with APG/Atlantic and his previous
                records were removed from iTunes.[34] In February 2015, Puth
                released his debut single "Marvin Gaye", which features American
                singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor.[35] The single has been
                certified 2Ã— Platinum in Australia, topped the charts in New
                Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, and peaked at number
                21 on the US Billboard Hot 100.[36][37] Puth wrote, co-produced,
                and was featured on a song with Wiz Khalifa, "See You Again", a
                tribute to the late Paul Walker, included in the Furious 7
                soundtrack. While Khalifa wrote the rap lyrics, the rest of the
                song has been credited to Puth. The song peaked at number one on
                the Hot 100 chart for 12 non-consecutive weeks.[38][39] "See You
                Again" was nominated for three Grammy Awards: Song of the Year,
                Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Song Written for Visual
                Media.
